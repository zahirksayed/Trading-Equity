## 📊 RSI + MACD Explained

### 📉 RSI (Relative Strength Index)

* **30–45** = Oversold Zone (Good for Averaging)
* **50+** = Recovery gaining strength

### 🔁 MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

* **MACD Line crosses above Signal Line** = Bullish signal
* Especially strong when crossover happens **below 0 line** (deep pullback)

#### ✅ Entry Signal:

* RSI: between **30 and 45**
* MACD: **Crossover confirmed**
* Price at/near **strong support**

A **Volume Spike** occurs when a candle has:

* **1.5x to 2x higher volume** than the last few candles (say 10)
* Often indicates:

  * News-based interest

### 🔍 How to Spot:
