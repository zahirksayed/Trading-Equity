## ðŸ§  What is a Pullback?

> A **pullback** is a temporary reversal in the direction of a prevailing trend.

* In an **uptrend**: It's a short-term dip in price before continuing upward.
* In a **downtrend**: It's a small upward move before resuming the downward trend.

ðŸŸ¢ It's **normal** market behavior â€” NOT a trend reversal.

## ðŸ›  Tools to Identify Pullbacks

### ðŸ”¹ Fibonacci Retracement Levels

* Common retracement levels: 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%.
* Used to identify support/resistance in pullbacks.

### ðŸ”¹ Trendlines / Channels

* Stop Loss: Below swing low.

### 2. **Fibonacci Retracement Entry**

* Identify recent impulse move.
* Use retracement tool to draw levels.
* Buy at 38.2% / 50% / 61.8% with confirmation.
* SL below 61.8% or next support.

### 3. **Breakout + Retest Strategy**

## ðŸ§ª Advanced Strategy: Multi-Timeframe Pullback

## ðŸš« Mistakes to Avoid

* Assuming all dips are pullbacks (watch trend strength).
* Entering before confirmation.
* Ignoring volume and fundamentals.
