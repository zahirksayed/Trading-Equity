To recover from a **30% unrealized loss** on a fundamentally strong stock, averaging down **strategically** is important — especially **when the stock shows signs of recovery from a strong support zone** (pullback strategy).

Here’s a **disciplined approach with 3 to 5 levels of adding** positions to recover the loss and improve your average cost effectively, **without overexposing**:

---

### ✅ **Step-by-Step Averaging Strategy (Pullback Based)**

**Assumptions:**

* You hold 100 shares at ₹100 (your cost), CMP = ₹70 (30% unrealized loss).
* Support is observed near ₹65–₹70.
* You can invest more capital gradually.

---

### 🎯 Goal:

* Reduce average price to **\~₹80 or below**, so that stock recovery to ₹85–₹90 gives you full exit or partial profit.

### 💡 Add-on Plan (Based on Pullback Signals)

| Add Level | Price Zone         | Quantity | Rationale                                    |
| --------- | ------------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Level 1   | ₹68–₹70            | 20% more | Entry near major support with reversal signs |
| Level 2   | ₹64–₹66            | 30% more | If stock dips further, strong base zone      |
| Level 3   | ₹72–₹74 (pullback) | 25% more | If reversal begins, confirm trend reversal   |
| Level 4   | ₹77–₹80            | 15% more | Add on strength, momentum rising             |
| Level 5   | ₹84–₹86            | 10% more | Final push if breakout sustains              |

> 💬 *Optional: Skip Level 4 or 5 if capital is tight or stock is highly volatile.*

### 📈 Average Price Simulation (Example)

| Buy Price | Qty | Cost    |
| --------- | --- | ------- |
| ₹100      | 100 | ₹10,000 |
| ₹68       | 20  | ₹1,360  |
| ₹64       | 30  | ₹1,920  |
| ₹72       | 25  | ₹1,800  |
| ₹77       | 15  | ₹1,155  |
| ₹85       | 10  | ₹850    |
| **Total** | 200 | ₹17,085 |

✅ **New Avg. Price = ₹17,085 / 200 = ₹85.42**
If you exit at ₹90, you get **\~5.3% profit on total investment** and recover original loss.

---

### 🔍 Rules for Entry at Each Level:

* **Use 1H/4H chart + RSI/VWAP** to confirm bounce at key levels.
* Watch for **volume spikes** and bullish candles (like Hammer, Bullish Engulfing).
* Don’t add if stock **breaks support decisively** with volume.

---

### 🚨 Risk Controls:

* Don’t exceed **2x or 2.5x original capital** unless you are very confident.
* Set exit targets: Partial at ₹85–₹90, full at ₹95+
* Set SL (mental or trailing) if downtrend continues after pullback fails.
