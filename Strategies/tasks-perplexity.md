Yes, Perplexity can provide automated weekly reporting through its latest task scheduling features and integrations, making it suitable for consistent financial summaries like Nifty 100 performance reports.

## Perplexity Task Scheduling Capabilities

- **Tasks Feature:** Perplexity now lets users create personalized, recurring tasks on any topic—including stock market summaries—using natural language prompts. These tasks can be set to run on a specific schedule such as weekly or daily.[1][2][3]
- **WhatsApp Integration:** Perplexity’s AI chatbot can be activated in WhatsApp, where users can schedule tasks and reminders. For example, one can receive an automated Nifty 100 report each week via WhatsApp, simply by requesting it from the bot and setting the schedule in natural language.[4][5][6]
- **Workflow Automation:** Perplexity integrates well with no-code workflow automation platforms like Make (formerly Integromat), n8n, and Zapier. This allows more advanced users to trigger automated research, compile reports, and route them to email, Slack, Notion, Discord, or Google Sheets on a set schedule.[7][8][9][10][11][12]
- **Enterprise Tools:** Pro users and organizations can use Perplexity Labs for bulk or advanced reporting, and “Deep Research” mode is available for comprehensive, expert-level reports that can be scheduled and shared as PDF documents or pages.[13][14]

## Example Use Cases

- **Weekly Nifty 100 Report to WhatsApp/Email:** “Send me the latest Nifty 100 index summary with top gainers and losers every Monday at 8:00 AM.”
- **Automated Delivery to Notion, Sheets, Email:** Integrate Perplexity with Make or Zapier to pull fresh index data, use a custom prompt for the report, and send it automatically each week.

## How to Enable

1. Activate the Perplexity Tasks feature on web or WhatsApp.[6][1][4]
2. Set up a recurring prompt, such as “Provide a Nifty 100 weekly summary with pullers and draggers.”
3. Specify the delivery method (WhatsApp message, email, or integration with your chosen productivity app).

**In summary:**  
Perplexity enables users to automate and receive weekly Nifty 100 reports through its native scheduling, WhatsApp chatbot, and integration-friendly automation features, supporting flexible and hands-free financial info delivery.[2][9][11][1][4][6][7][13]
